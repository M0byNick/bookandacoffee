# bookandacoffee

Final project of the Columbia University Engineering (Fu Foundation) Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp.

My team and I built an application to allow registered users to search for books using the Google Books API and then save them for later interest, display a list of already read books, and write reviews that are shared with other users.

We used MongoDB, React, GraphQL, and JS
